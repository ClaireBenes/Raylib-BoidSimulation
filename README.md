# Boid Simulation 🐟

This project is a **Boid Simulation** where fish-like agents move autonomously in a 2D environment.  
The simulation implements flocking behavior (alignment, cohesion, separation) and includes **predator-prey interactions** as well as **dynamic obstacles** that can be added at runtime simply by dragging with the mouse.

## ✨ Features
- Autonomous **boid movement** (flocking behavior).
- **Obstacle avoidance** with interactive runtime placement.
- **Predator & prey mechanics** between different boid types.
